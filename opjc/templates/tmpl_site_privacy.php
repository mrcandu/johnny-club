  you, respond to your enquiries, get in touch with you about other products and

  our website.</p>
      <p><strong>5.1. Marketing and business development purposes</strong></p>
<p>Apart from using your personal information to process any orders you may place, 
  if you provide CBRU Ltd with an email address, it will automatically be entered 
  into our regular email update service. If you do not wish to receive updates 
  or marketing information, please amend your mailing preferences in the My Account 
  section.</p>
<p>If you do not object to receiving marketing material at the time the information

  may continue to receive information for up to 7 days after the date on which 
  you update your account.</p>

  to help identify problems with our server and to administer our website.</p>
      <p><strong>6. The ability to edit and cancel your account</strong></p>
<p>You can access 'My Account' from every page on the site to update and correct 
  the personal details that we gathered when you subscribed. You must be logged 
  in to access this information. All information is password-protected so no one 
  can access the information but you. We are required to retain your information 
  for accounting and taxation purposes.</p>
      <p><strong>7. Information sharing and disclosure</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>CBRU Ltd is committed to protecting your personal information. We will not 
    disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties without 
    your consent except where:</li>
  <li>CBRU Ltd is required by law to disclose information to third parties.<br>
    The service is necessary for the performance of our operations i.e. mail delivery, 
    hosting services, protecting us from fraud, and payment of your account.</li>
  <li>CBRU Ltd buys or sells subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions 
    customer information is one of the transferred assets, but would remain subject 
    to the commitments made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy or equivalent.</li>
</ul>
<p>CBRU Ltd also provides analyses of our customers in the aggregate to prospective 
  partners, advertisers and other third parties. We do this so that we and our 
  business partners can understand you better, and so we can keep bringing you 
  first-rate services. We may also disclose, on an anonymous basis, literal statements 
  made by our customers. At no time, however, will we disclose personal information 
  about specific customers.</p>
<p>Linked websites are not under the control of CBRU Ltd and we are not responsible 
  for the conduct of companies linked to our website. Before disclosing your personal 
  information on any other website we advise you to examine their terms and conditions 
  of use. As a subscriber you have certain rights under the Data Protection Act 
  1998. You have the right to be told what personal information we hold about 
  you on our database. Should you wish to exercise that right, or if you have 
  any questions concerning the CBRU Ltd privacy policy please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>8. Security</strong></p>
<p>CBRU Ltd has implemented technology and security features, as well as strict 
  internal guidelines, to safeguard the privacy of your personal information from 
  unauthorised access or improper use. We will continue to enhance our security 
  procedures as new technology becomes available.</p>
<p>While we make every effort to ensure that your information is secure on our 
  system, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% 
  secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you 
  transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.<br>
  Your CBRU Ltd account information is password-protected for your privacy and 
  security. You can play an important role in keeping your personal information 
  secure by maintaining the confidentiality of your password used on the CBRU 
  Ltd website. We recommend that you change your password from time to time for 
  additional security. Please advise us immediately if there is any unauthorised 
  use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of security.<br>
  Access authorisation is granted to key CBRU Ltd staff only. Backups are run 
  to prevent loss of information, and our Internet servers are housed in secure 
  facilities.</p>
